# Theme 4: Utilities
# 
# This theme covers topics that do not easily fit into the other themes:
#   
#   Installing–Notes on installing R and additional packages of R commands.
# Using R–Including accessing the help system, history of previously typed commands and managing packages.
# Programming–Commands that are used mostly in the production of custom functions and scripts. These can be thought of as the “tools” of the programming language.
